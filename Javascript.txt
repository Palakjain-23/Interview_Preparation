<<-----------Javascript----------------->>

Scripting language :
    They are language that consists of instructions written for run time environment.They are not compiled rather interpreted.

Javascript
    Scripting language and it is lightweight and cross platform
    It is weakly typed which means the var can hold any type of value (string bool array);

Data types : 
    Primitive types : Number
                      Boolean
                      String
                      Symbol (they are primitive types that return unique values)
                    
    Non primitive types: Array
                         Object
                         Function

Hoisting :
    It is behaviour of js where the declaration of var,function are moved to the top of the scope in which they are defined.

Undefined and not defined
    Undefined : It means that var is initialized but it is not assigned any value.
    not defined : It means that var is not declared before using it.

Let and Const :
    They are block scoped variables which means they can be accessed in the scope where they are declared.

First Class Function
    the ability of passing function as a argument to another function andÂ  return a function is called first class function    

Higher Order Function
    Function that takes another function as argument(callback function) is known as Higher order functions.    

const arr=[{name:"palak",surname:"jain",age:22},
{name:"pratham",surname:"jain",age:21}]

Map  :
    It is used in one to one mapping with array and used when we want to apply transformation in whole array.
    eg : const arr1=arr.map((e)=>e.name+" "+e.surname)

Filter :
   It is used to filter out the element
   eg: const arr2=arr.filter((e)=>e.age==22).map((e)=>e.name)

Promise :
   It is defined as the eventual completion of async operation.
   It has 4state
   Pending : result is undefined.
   Fullfilled : result is a value.
   Rejected : result is error object.

   let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
     let name="palak";
     let name1="pratham";
     if(name==name1){
        resolve();
     }else{
        reject();
     }
   });
   promise.then(funtion(){
    console.log("success");
   }).catch(funtion()
   {
    console.log("something wrong")
   })

JSON :
    It stands for js object notation.
    It is a format to store data and transport data.
    We receive JSon data from web server.

Cookies :
    It is a set of info stored in users computer when a user visits a particular website so that it can remember the user info when user visits a webpage.

Document :
    It is a object that represent the whole html document.when html is loaded in browser it becomes document object.

Arrow function
    {()=>} is concise way of writing JavaScript functions in shorter way. 
    eg.const run=()=>{console.log("run");}

this
    It represents the current scope in which a code is executing.
    Eg. const obj1={
        name:"palak",
        n(){
            console.log(`here name is $(this.name)`);
        }
      }
      obj1.n();
