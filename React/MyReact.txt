<<~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ReactJS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>>
    ReactJs is a Opensource Library that is used to create User Interface.It is used for making single page applications.
   
    Component are the small pieces of mangeable code.

API : 
    It is set of rules that allow a software application to communicate with another software application . It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service provider and then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired user. 

REST Api : 
   it stands for representational state transfer. it is architectural software that defines on how Api should work.And the api that follow this architecture is called restful api.

Two Types of components are 
    : Class-Based Components 
       class bank extends ReactComponent{
        render(){
            return <h1>Weolcome to Bank!! </h1>
        }
       }
       export default bank;
    : Function Based Component 
      function bank(){
        return({
            <>
            <div>
                <h1>WElcome</h1>
            </div>
            </>
        })
      }

Bundler
    is a development tool that combines many JavaScript code files into a single one that is production-ready loadable in the browser. 

React Lifecycle
    :Initializing
        this is the stage when constructor is created with given props .this is done in constructor.
    :Mounting 
        Here instance of component is created .
        It consists of methods like componentDidMount(invoked immediate before render ), componentWillUnmount(invoved immediate after render).  
    :Updating
        it is the stage when the  state of the component is updated. 
    :UnMount 
        it is the stage when component is removed from the page.    

JSX
    It is javascript Syntax Extension it allows us to write html inside javascipt file.

State 
    It is the way to store and manage information while creating a react application.

Props
    they are the way to pass data from one component to another.

DOM
   It is the actual tree like structure of a web page which can be manipulated directly to change the layout or content of the page. 

Virtual DOM
    It is the copy of actual dom react uses it to improve performance by updating only the changed parts of the actual dom.

Keys 
    They help in uniquely identify and differentiate between components in react.

React Router
   It is library that allow routing and enables navigation among views in react application.

Hooks 
    are the function that allow functional components to use state and other react features.

Lazy loading
    It is a technique where components are loaded only when they are actually needed,improving initial load time.

Refs 
    are used to access the dom directly or to reference a react element.

useState Hooks 
    It allow developer to add state to a functional component.
    
    import react from 'React';
    function Increase(){
        const[count,setCount]=useState(0);
        function increaseCount(){
            setCount=count+1;
        }
        return({
            <div>
                <button onClick=(increseCount)>Increse</button>
            </div>
        })
    }
    export default Increase;

usememo Hook
    It is used to memoize a value to improve the overhead of recalculating. 

Redux 
    it is library that used for state management.
    When event occurs it dispatches a action and it will call a reducer function which will modify the slice of store(it is object that is placed in global central place )
    and this is for writing the data for reading the data store should be subscribed to the store using selector.
