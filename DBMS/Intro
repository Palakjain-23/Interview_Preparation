1.  DataBase
    Group of interrelated record is called dataBase.

2.  DataBase Management System
    It is a sytem software that is used to manage, store and retrieve data from dataBase. It allow user to create, modify and query a database.

3. Feature of DataBase Management System
   ~ Quick Access
   ~ Reduce data redundancy
   ~ Backup and Recovery
   ~ Easy Maintenance

4. Languages of DataBase Management System

    4.1 Data Definition Language
        It works on structure and schema of dataBase.
        ~command : Create,Drop,Truncate,Alter   (CDTA)

    4.2 Data Manipulation Language
        It works with data manipulation and inlcude 
        ~command : select,insert,update,delete (UIDS)

    4.3 Data Control Language
        It is used to grant or revoke the permissions to users in the database and they are used to control user privileges in db.
        ~command : Grant,Revoke

    4.4 Tansancation Control Language 
        It is used to manage all types of transaction data.
        ~command : Commit,Rollback

5.  ACID Properties

    In order to maintain consistency in a database, before and after the transaction, certain properties are followed. These are called ACID properties.

    ~ Atomicity : It states that transaction either complete or donot complete  their is no midway.Transcation cannot occur partially.
    Example : If A wants to transfer $100 to B then first step will be deduction from A's account and then tranfer to B's account.
    If amount is deducted from a and not received to b then in this case rollback of entire transcation happens.

    ~ Consistent : Data should remain consistent before and after the transaction.     
    Example : If a is sending amount to b and c then fisrt amount deducted from a and send to b updation in account of b and similarly in c. so database should remain consistent during whole transcation.

    ~ Isolation : It means that multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to inconsistency.
    Example :  If a two transcation is occuring concurrently in different accounts then they no changes due to parallel transactions.

    ~ Durability : It means that if transaction is completed and data is saved to the disk so data persists even if system failure occur.
    Example : A sends amount to B and transaction is completed so details of this transaction persists even if system failure occurs.
