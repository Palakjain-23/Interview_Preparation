---------Bubble Sort---------
It this Sorting technique in which the max element in each pass comes to the last of array by swapping 
T.C
    Best - 0(n)
    Worst - 0(n2)

S.C 0(1)

Stable - retain order of same key of values
Inplace - no space required

---------Insertion Sort----------

It this Sorting technique Elemnts are moved to the sorted part one by one from unorted part 

T.C
    Best-0(n)
    Worst- 0(n2)
S.C 0(1)    
Stable- retain order of same key of values
Inplace- no space required

---------Selection Sort---------

It is a algorithm in which minimum elemnt is to be selected and placed in sorted part of array;

T.C-Best/Worst-0(n2)

InStable- donot retain order of same key of values
Inplace- no space required

-----------Merge Sort------------

This sorting algorithm is based on divide and conqueue algorithm here the array is divided till only single element remain and then they are merged.

T.C 
Best/Worst-0(nlogn)

S.C - 0(n)

Stable- retain order of same key of values
not Inplace- space required

---------Quick Sort---------

It is also based on divide and conqueue algorithm here the element is picked as pivot and the array is partition around this element and by placing the pivot in its correct position.

T.C
    Best - 0(nlogn)
    Worst - 0(n2)

InStable - donot retain order of same key of values
Inplace - No  space required
