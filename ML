Machine Learning
    It is the subset of ai its main focus is learning from data and develop algorithm that can help make predictions.
    It is data driven approach it uses historic data to train  the model and it is used to make predictions on new data.

 supervised learning
     technique where an algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset to predict the class or category of new, unseen data.

Unsupervised leaning not labeled dataset

Reinforcement learning where machine learns from feedbacks

AI - it is the branch of computer science that focus on creating a system that is cable of performing operation that require human intelligence.
