---------------[Graph]-----------------
Is is a non linear data structure that consists of a set of edges and vertices.Vertices are sometime referred to as nodes and edges are line that connnectthem.

Applications of Graph

~ It can be used to represent a relationship between computer networks such as   routers and switches.
~ It can be used to represent connection between different places in transportation netwok such as roads services.

Types of Graph

    1. Connected graph
        a connected graph is a graph in which we can reach all nodes from one node.

    2. DisConnected graph
        a disconnected graph is a graph in which their is at least one node that is not reachable.

    3. Directed graph
        a directed graph is a graph in which each node has a direction.

    4. UnDirected graph
        a un-directed graph is a graph in which direction  of all nodes are not present.

Representation of Graph Data Structure:
~ There are two ways to store a graph:

    ~~ Adjacency Matrix
    ~~ Adjacency List

            Adjacency Matrix	Adjacency List
Adding Edge	        O(1)	            O(1)
Removing an edge	O(1)	            O(N)
Initializing	    O(N*N)	            O(N)
