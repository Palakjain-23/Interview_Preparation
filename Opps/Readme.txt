--------Opps------------
Its refers to languages that uses object and classes in programming.
There are four pillars of Opps

1-> Abstraction 
    It is defined as showing only the essential details and hiding implementation part.

    Example : While riding a car a person press start button but does not know actually how does car start after button press.

2-> Encapsulation   
    It is defined as wrapping up of data into single unit.

    Example : Suppose in a company their are two sectors finance and sales and all data regarding them are stored into them saparatly.But if a sales person want some details of finance then they cannot directly acess them . They asked the permission from finance department officer.

3-> Polymorphism 
    It refers to many forms.Another words its the ability of message to be displayed in different forms.

    Example : When a person behaves like a student in school employee in office son/daughter at home .

    Types of Polymorphism
    3.1->  Compile-Time Polymorphism
           Example of this is method overloading 
           It mean a function with same name and different parameter and return type .

    3.2->  Run-Time Polymorphism
           Example of this is method Overiding
           It means a function in a parent class is tobe inherited in base class  with same name and same return type

4-> Inheritance
    It is the capacity of a class to derive methods and members from another class 
    4-1-> Single Inheritance
    4.2-> Multiple Inheritance
    4.3-> Multilevel Inheritance
    4.4-> Hybrid Inheritance
    4.5-> Hyrarichal Inheritance
